# Campaign Matching Dashboard

This project is aimed at automating the matching of campaigns in Origin across different platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The end product is a user-friendly dashboard built using Dash, where users can view similarity scores generated by BERT or Word2Vec models and manually select the best matching campaign.


## Features

- **NLP-Based Matching**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques such as BERT and Word2Vec to compute similarity scores between campaign texts.
- **Dashboard Interface**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard interface built using Dash, enabling users to visualize and interact with the similarity scores.
- **Manual Selection**: Allows users to manually select the best matching campaign based on the computed similarity scores.
